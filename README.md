## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze student performance by examining various factors such as study hours, attendance rate, sleep patterns, and social media usage. By exploring correlations between these factors and academic performance (exam scores, assignment completion rates), we seek to uncover insights that can help students and educators improve learning outcomes.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis contains student performance metrics, including:
- Demographics (Age, Gender, Student_ID  )
- Study Behavior (Study hours per week, online courses completed)
- Performance Metrics (Assignment completion rate, Attendance rate, Participation in Discussions)
- Lifestyle Factors (Time spent on social media per week, Use of Educational Tech )
- Academic performance (Grades, Exam score)
- Learning styles (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, Reading/Writing)
- Self Care (Self_Reported_Stress_Level, Sleep hours per night )
  
The dataset was sourced from 
```
 (https://www.Kaggle.com).

## Tools used in this analysis
The Tools used in this analysis are as follows:
- Python (Programming Language)
- Pandas (Data manipulation)
- NumPy (Numerical computations)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code (Development environment)

## Data Cleaning/Preparation 
The dataset was cleaned by:
- Removing missing or null values
- Removing duplicate columns 
- Replacing infinite values with appropriate values
- Standardizing column names for consistency
- Ensuring all numerical values were in the correct format

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA was performed to:
- Understand the distribution of numerical and categorical variables
- Identify outliers and anomalies
- Visualize correlations between variables
- Detect trends using histograms, barplots, piechart, group barchart and scatterplots

Key Visualizations:
- Correlation heatmap – Identified relationships between variables
- Distribution plots – Showed how exam scores varied with study hours and social media usage
- Preferred learning styles - visual, kinesthetic, Auditory, Reading/ writing
- Gender - Male, Female and other
- Preferred learning styles and exam scores 

## Data Analysis
Key Research Questions:
- How does study time impact student performance?
- How does use of tech impact student performance?
- Does social media usage negatively affect exam scores?
- Is there a correlation between sleep hours and academic success?
- Is there a correlation between sleep hours and Self-Reported Stress Level?
- How does attendance rate influence exam performance?
- How does learning styles impact student performance?

Methods Used:
- Correlation Analysis – To identify relationships between variables
- Descriptive Statistics – Mean, median, standard deviation of key metrics
- Data Visualizations – Heatmaps, bar charts, scatter plots, pie chart, group barchart
